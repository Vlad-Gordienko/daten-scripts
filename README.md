# Wetteraukreis Data Processing

This project contains scripts for processing official demographic, employment, and address data from the Wetteraukreis region. The goal is to prepare clean and normalized Excel files that are ready for visualization in Apache Superset or further analysis.

## Purpose

- Normalize messy Excel exports from different sources
- Standardize Gemeinde names using aliases and mappings
- Aggregate population data by age and year
- Geocode addresses for mapping in Superset
- Automate yearly and regional data handling

## How to Use

1. Place source Excel files into the appropriate folders inside `data/`.
2. Run the relevant scripts individually depending on your data type:
   ```bash
   python3 altersverteilung.py
   python3 arbeitsortbesch√§ftigung.py
   python3 geburtsjahrgangsstatistik.py
   python3 altersplanung.py

3. Output files will be saved in the result/ directory.

## Geocoding
 - Address geolocation is cached to avoid redundant API calls.
 - Cache is stored in geocode_cache.json.
 - Invalid or unrecognized addresses are skipped without breaking the script.

## Extending the Project
 - To support new Gemeinden or alternate names: update gemeinde_aliases.py.
 - To map new Gebiet values: extend files in gemeinden/.
 - To add new data sources: create a new script following the same pattern and reuse helpers from common/.

## Notes for Developers
 - Code is modular: mapping, aliasing, geocoding, and parsing logic is reusable.
 - Focus on minimal dependencies and readable logic for future maintenance.
